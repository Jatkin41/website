                    Hi, I'm Josh Atkinson - a 22 year old, Master of Cyber Security student from Melbourne, Australia. <br>
                    I have previously studied a Bachelor of Forensic Science where I gained: <br>
                    <div>
                        &#10518 A strong knowledge of biology, notably surrounding DNA, genetics, and microbiology <br>
                        &#10518 A strong knowledge of discipline related aspects in chemistry including toxicology and pharmacology <br>
                        &#10518 Developed researching skills, and <br>
                        &#10518 A solid understanding of the implications of ethics within multiple domains <br>
                    </div> <br>
                    In addition I have also developed a knowledge in several areas related to my Master's degree, including: <br> <br>
                    <div>
                        &#10518 Experience coding in several languages, notably C# and HTML, and <br>
                        &#10518 A knowledge of various types and methods of cyber attacks <br>
                    </div> <br>
                    This is an area which I am continuously developing. <br>
                    Currently for my Master's, I am part of a project developing penetration testing software for use by non-cyber experts. <br>
